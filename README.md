## About Application

This Admin Panel Application was built to learn how to use:

- Syncfusion React UI Components (Essential JS 2) - a modern UI components library that has been built from the ground up to be lightweight, responsive, modular and touch friendly.
- Tailwind CSS - a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier

These tools helped to build an admin dashboard, 3 pages (with grid component), 4 apps: a kanban board, a calendar, a color picker, a text editor and several different charts. The application has 6 color themes and a light/dark mode.
The main goal was to use as many Syncfusion components as possible. Database implementation was not a priority in this project, so dummy data was used and some features are simply hardcoded.

## Installation

1. Start terminal and clone repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/magda-korzeniowska/admin-panel-app
   ```
2. Install all dependencies => go the main directory of the react-challenge repository:

   ```bash
   cd admin-panel-app
   ```

   and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. After running npm start, the React App should open automatically in your browser. If it doesn't, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
